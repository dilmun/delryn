# delryn — Roadmap

Living backlog. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the target structure and `DESIGN.md`
for the original spec. Phases are sequential; within a phase, items ship in
small green commits (build + `cargo test` + `cargo clippy` clean each step).

## Phase 0 — Foundation (`refactor/workspace`) — ✅ complete

Migrate to a Cargo workspace and clear every dev docs violation. Done: workspace
extracted into 8 crates; the `app` god-object and every god-file (store, epub,
library/meta_edit views) split into focused modules; let-chains modernization;
`cargo clippy` 0-warning workspace-wide. Every multi-concern file — including the
editor and reader view-models and the App-core dispatch — is split by concern
(modularity is first-class, not gated on size). No file in the core logic exceeds
the size guidelines.

- [x] Workspace skeleton: root `[workspace]`, crate → `crates/delryn`.
- [x] Extract `delryn-model` (content/metadata/toc/math types + naming helpers).
- [x] Extract `delryn-infra` (paths + config + theme; task/cache/export later).
- [x] Extract `delryn-store` (SQLite). *Split by entity later.*
- [x] Extract `delryn-online` (metadata/cover lookup).
- [x] Extract `delryn-media` (image protocols/decode).
- [x] Extract `delryn-format` (Document trait + epub: read/extract/cover/html).
- [x] Extract `delryn-render` (layout + highlight; paginate/table later).
- [x] Extract `delryn-library` (scan/index; collections/query/dedup/stats later).
- [x] Modernize: let-chains (killed the 28 collapsible_if) + the 3 real clippy
      fixes → **0 warnings workspace-wide**.
- [x] `cargo fmt` the workspace (canonical Rust 1.96 style).
- [x] Reinstall path is now `cargo install --path crates/delryn`.
- [x] Split `app.rs` into `app/` submodules: `confirm`, `settings`, `mouse`,
      `rename`, `select`, `collections`, `editor`, `reader`, `library` (mod.rs
      5.6k → ~1.9k, of which ~1.0k is the inline test module; ~0.9k non-test App
      core: struct + constructors + lifecycle + `on_key`/`apply` dispatch + overlay
      key handlers). Each a green commit. Pattern: child-module `impl App`,
      cross-module methods `pub(crate)`, types re-exported from `mod.rs`; concern
      tests stay in mod.rs (shared `key`/`ctrl`/`code` helpers).
- [x] Split the App-core dispatch into `app/dispatch.rs`: `on_key`, the overlay
      key handlers (images/notes/annotations/search prompt), and `apply` — routing
      is its own concern (mod.rs non-test core ~900 → ~500).
- [x] Sub-split `app/editor.rs` (1172 → mod 699 + `editor/lookup.rs` 485): the
      online metadata/cover lookup + background execution as a child module.
- [x] Sub-split `app/reader.rs` (1044 → mod 601 + `images`/`sidebar`/`search`):
      image lifecycle, TOC sidebar, in-book search as child modules; core loop
      (decode/wrap/scroll/nav/history) stays in mod.rs.
- [x] Split oversized views: `view/library` (814 → library/ dir: grid/detail/
      sections/books/status) and `view/meta_edit` (619 → meta_edit/ dir: hits +
      online), each leaving render() + shared helpers in mod.rs.
- [x] Split `delryn-store` (1065 → ~590) by entity (books/progress/annotations/
      shelves/search submodules, each an `impl Store` block).
- [x] Split `delryn-format::epub` (997 → mod 575 + content_meta 437): carve the
      content-based metadata heuristics into `epub/content_meta.rs`.
- [x] Resolve the 4 `#[allow(too_many_arguments)]`: `view::reader::render_column`
      was under threshold (allow removed); `meta_edit::form_field` grouped its 5
      field-state args into a `FieldState` struct; the two `Store` row-writers
      (`upsert_book`/`update_book_meta`) keep a *documented* scoped suppression —
      their args are the `books` columns 1:1, so a param struct would only shadow
      the table (and would churn ~30 call sites). `cargo clippy` is 0-warning.

## Phase 1 — Technical content rendering

- [x] Rich `Block` model: `Math`/`Table`/`Callout`/`Footnote` variants + figure
      captions on `Image`; `CalloutKind` (label + `from_word` classifier). Layout
      renders all (centred Unicode math, aligned tables w/ header rule, bordered
      callouts/footnotes via a width-aware nested wrapper). Producers land per-
      feature below. *(Citation/CrossRef are inline — they arrive with footnotes.)*
- [x] Code blocks: syntect highlight, line numbers, wrap/h-scroll, copy, and
      next/prev navigation (`w`/`b`, "code N/M"). *Deferred: code-index overlay +
      export → unified jump-by-type / export pass.*
- [x] Callouts/admonitions (NOTE/TIP/WARNING/…), block quotes. Parser emits
      `Block::Callout` from class/`epub:type` tokens + aside-icon tables; rendered
      as a bordered, labelled box. Block quotes unchanged.
- [x] Tables: parse `<table>` → `Block::Table` (header from `<thead>`/all-`<th>`),
      rendered as aligned columns + header rule. *Deferred: h-scroll/viewer/nav.*
- [x] Footnotes + cross-references: `Span` carries an `Anchor` (link/footnote/
      cross-ref/citation); parser stamps `<a>` runs and lifts footnote defs into
      `Block::Footnote` (muted). *Deferred: ref→def jump/return/preview — needs a
      reader cursor (Phase 2).*
- [x] Math: inline (LaTeX-alt img → Unicode span) + display detection
      (standalone math img/container → `Block::Math`, centred, `LineKind::Math`).
      *Deferred: next/prev + index → jump-by-type pass.*

Phase 1 content model is complete end-to-end (parse → rich `Block` → render).
The deferred bits are all *interactive navigation*, gathered into Phase 2's
jump-by-type + a reader cursor.

## Phase 2 — Reading experience

- [ ] Reading modes: Continuous, Page, Chapter, Focus, Study, Research, Presentation.
- [ ] Pagination models: continuous / virtual pages / book pages (PDF) / reflowed.
- [ ] Navigation: reading history, navigation history (back/forward), jump-by-type.
- [ ] Bookmarks: named, quick, folders.

## Phase 3 — Library platform

- [ ] Views: Table (sortable columns), Cover Wall; refine Grid/List.
- [ ] Smart collections + filter DSL (`tag:rust AND rating>=4`, `status:reading`).
- [ ] Reading status (Unread/Reading/Paused/Finished/Dropped/Reference) + rating.
- [ ] Duplicate detection across formats; merge/keep/remove.
- [ ] Metadata diff view (current vs remote, selective apply).

## Phase 4 — Knowledge & power tools

- [ ] Highlights (colors), notes (selection/para/chapter/page), tags, backlinks.
- [ ] Statistics: books/pages/hours/streak/speed/authors/genres.
- [ ] Export: notes/highlights/bookmarks/metadata/stats → MD/JSON/CSV/HTML.
- [ ] Command palette (VSCode-style).

## Phase 5 — Formats

- [ ] PDF (`delryn-format::pdf`): page model, text extraction, figures.
- [ ] MOBI / AZW3.

## Phase 6 — Graphical math + deep performance

- [ ] Graphical math (typst/shell → image via terminal graphics), cached.
- [ ] Virtualized scrolling, incremental parsing, aggressive caching at scale.
